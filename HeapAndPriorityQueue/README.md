## Heap

### Brief Summary of Heap:
A heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure.

In a heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to (for a max heap) or less than or equal to (for a min heap) the values of its children.

Heaps are typically implemented using arrays to achieve efficient storage and access.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. Complete Binary Tree: Heaps are complete binary trees, meaning all levels are filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

2. Heap Property: Heaps satisfy the heap property, which states that for a max heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and for a min heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

3. Array Representation: Heaps are commonly implemented using arrays, where the parent-child relationship is preserved by using index arithmetic.

4. Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Heaps support efficient insertion and deletion operations, typically with logarithmic time complexity, while maintaining the heap property.

5. Heapify Operation: Heapify is an operation that adjusts the heap structure to maintain the heap property after insertion or deletion.

6. Heap Operations: Common operations on heaps include inserting elements, removing elements, and accessing the minimum or maximum element without removing it.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. Priority Queues: Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are removed in order of their priority (highest or lowest value).

2. Heap Sort: Heapsort is a sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure, offering an efficient way to sort elements in ascending or descending order.

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Heaps are used in Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to efficiently select the next node with the smallest distance from a set of candidate nodes.

4. Median Maintenance: Heaps can be used to efficiently maintain the median of a dynamically changing set of numbers.

5. Task Scheduling: Heaps are employed in task scheduling algorithms to prioritize tasks based on their urgency or importance.

## Priority Queue

### Brief Summary of Priority Queue:
A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue but with each element having a priority associated with it.

Elements in a priority queue are dequeued based on their priority rather than the order of insertion.

Priority queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as heaps, balanced trees, or sorted arrays.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. Priority-Based Ordering: Priority queues prioritize elements based on their assigned priorities, where elements with higher priorities are dequeued before those with lower priorities.

2. Enqueue and Dequeue Operations: Priority queues support enqueue operations to insert elements with their associated priorities and dequeue operations to remove elements with the highest (or lowest) priority.

3. Implementation Flexibility: Priority queues can be implemented using different underlying data structures, such as heaps for efficient operations or sorted arrays for simplicity.

4. Efficient Operations: Priority queues typically offer efficient enqueue and dequeue operations, with logarithmic or constant time complexity, depending on the implementation.

5. Support for Duplicate Priorities: Some priority queue implementations allow elements with the same priority to be enqueued and dequeued in any order, while others may impose a specific order based on insertion time.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. Job Scheduling: Priority queues are widely used in job scheduling algorithms to prioritize tasks based on their urgency or importance, ensuring critical tasks are executed first.

2. Operating Systems: Priority queues are employed in operating systems to manage various system resources, such as CPU scheduling, disk I/O, and network packet processing.

3. Event-Driven Simulations: Priority queues are useful in event-driven simulations to schedule events based on their simulated time or priority, facilitating the execution of events in the correct order.

4. Pathfinding Algorithms: Priority queues play a crucial role in pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search algorithm, by selecting the next node to explore based on its priority or estimated cost.
