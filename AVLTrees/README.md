## AVLTree

AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis. It maintains a balanced structure by performing rotations whenever necessary during insertion and deletion operations, ensuring that the tree remains approximately balanced.

### Brief Summary of AVL Tree:

An AVL Tree is a binary search tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most one (the balance property).

The balance factor of a node is defined as the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree. AVL trees require that the balance factor of every node in the tree is either -1, 0, or 1.

To maintain the balance property, AVL trees perform rotations, which are tree restructuring operations, whenever the balance factor of any node violates the AVL property.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in the AVL tree contains the key, value (or payload), and pointers to its left and right children.

2. **Balancing Operations**: AVL trees maintain their balance by performing rotations such as single rotations (left or right) and double rotations (left-right or right-left) when necessary. These rotations help restore the balance factor of nodes.

3. **Insertion**: When inserting a new node, AVL trees perform the standard binary search tree insertion operation, followed by updating the balance factors of affected nodes and performing rotations to restore balance if needed.

4. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from an AVL tree involves performing the standard binary search tree deletion operation, followed by updating the balance factors and performing rotations to rebalance the tree.

5. **Traversal**: AVL trees support various traversal methods such as inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal, which allow visiting all nodes in the tree in different orders.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:

1. **Database Indexing**: AVL trees are used in database indexing to efficiently store and retrieve data, ensuring that the data remains balanced and retrievable in logarithmic time.

2. **Compiler Design**: AVL trees are employed in compiler design for symbol table management, where identifiers and their attributes are stored and retrieved efficiently during the compilation process.

3. **Text Editors**: AVL trees can be used in text editors for tasks such as autocomplete and spell checking, where efficient search and retrieval of words or phrases are required.

4. **File Systems**: AVL trees are used in file systems to maintain directory structures and efficiently search for files and directories.

5. **Network Routing**: AVL trees are used in network routing algorithms to store routing information efficiently, allowing routers to make quick routing decisions based on destination addresses.
