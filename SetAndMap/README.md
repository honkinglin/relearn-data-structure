## Set

### Brief Summary of Set:
A Set is a collection data structure.

It stores unique elements, without any particular order, and does not allow duplicates.

Sets typically provide efficient operations to add, remove, and check for the presence of elements.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. Uniqueness: Ensure that all elements in the set are unique, often by using a hashing mechanism to check for existing values during insertion.

2. No Fixed Order: Elements in a set are not stored in a specific sequence, which means that the data structure does not guarantee the order of elements.

3. Hashing: Use a hash table or some form of a hashing algorithm to achieve constant time complexity for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

4. Dynamic Sizing: Sets can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed, adjusting the allocated memory accordingly.

5. Iteration: Provide a means to iterate over the elements of the set, even though they are unordered.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. Membership Tests: Sets are ideal for scenarios where the primary operation is to check for the presence or absence of unique items, such as permission checks or feature flags.

2. Removing Duplicates: Sets can be used to filter out duplicates from a collection of data, ensuring that only unique elements remain.

3. Mathematical Set Operations: Sets support operations like union, intersection, difference, and subset checks, which are useful in various mathematical and algorithmic applications.

4. Data Representation: Sets can represent collections of non-repeating elements, such as tags for blog posts, vocabulary in text analysis, or unique users in a system.

## Map

### Brief Summary of Map:
A Map, also known as a dictionary or associative array, is a data structure.

It stores key-value pairs, where each unique key maps to a specific value.

Maps facilitate efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on their keys.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. Key-Value Pair: Structure the map to hold two elements together, a key and its corresponding value.

2. Unique Keys: Ensure that keys are unique within the map, often leveraging a hashing mechanism for key lookups.

3. Value Retrieval: Provide a method to retrieve values efficiently by using their associated keys.

4. Order: Some map implementations maintain the keys in a sorted order, while others do not guarantee any specific ordering.

5. Dynamic Sizing: Like sets, maps can dynamically resize, allowing for the addition and removal of key-value pairs.

6. Collision Handling: Implement a strategy to handle hash collisions, where two keys may produce the same hash value, such as chaining or open addressing.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. Database Indexing: Maps can serve as indexes in databases, allowing for quick data retrieval through unique keys.

2. Caching: Maps are used to implement caches where data can be stored and accessed quickly using keys that represent the data.

3. Associative Arrays: Maps provide the functionality of associative arrays, enabling the association of data through meaningful keys rather than numeric indices.

4. Counting and Grouping: Maps can be used to count occurrences of elements or group data by categorizing elements under specific keys.
