## Linked List

### Brief Summary of Linked List:
A linked list is a linear data structure.

Elements, called nodes, are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence, forming a chain-like structure.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. Node Structure: Define a node structure with two fields: data and a pointer to the next node.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocate memory for each node individually during runtime, providing flexibility in size.

3. Pointers: Utilize pointers to link nodes together and establish the sequence within the list.

4. Insertion and Deletion: Insert or delete nodes by updating the pointers of surrounding nodes, avoiding the need to shift elements.

5. No Fixed Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as needed, making them suitable for storing data of varying sizes.

6. Heterogeneous Elements (Optional): Linked lists can potentially store elements of different data types, although some implementations might restrict data type for simplicity.

7. Traversal: Traverse the linked list by following the pointers from the head node to visit each node in sequence.


### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. Dynamic Data Management: Linked lists are ideal for storing and manipulating data that frequently changes in size, such as implementing queues, stacks, and undo/redo functionality.

2. Sparse Arrays: Linked lists can efficiently represent sparse arrays where most elements are empty, avoiding wasted memory allocation for unused positions.

3. Unordered Data: Linked lists are well-suited for storing unordered data, where frequent insertions and deletions are prioritized over random access.

4. Graph Representation: Linked lists can be used to represent the vertices and edges of graphs, enabling the modeling of relationships between data points.
