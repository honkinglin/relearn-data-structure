## Stack

### Brief Summary of Stack:
A stack is a linear data structure.

Follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

It allows elements to be inserted and removed from only one end, known as the top of the stack.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. **Push Operation:** Adding elements onto the top of the stack.
2. **Pop Operation:** Removing the topmost element from the stack.
3. **Peek Operation:** Viewing the topmost element without removing it.
4. **Stack Pointer:** Keeping track of the top of the stack to enable push and pop operations.
5. **Empty Stack:** Handling cases where the stack is empty to prevent underflow errors.
6. **Full Stack:** Managing cases where the stack is full to prevent overflow errors.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. **Function Call Management:** Stacks are used to manage function calls in programming languages, allowing for nested function calls and returning to previous function states.
2. **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are employed in evaluating mathematical expressions, such as infix to postfix conversion and postfix expression evaluation.
3. **Undo Mechanisms:** Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms in software applications, allowing users to revert to previous states.
4. **Backtracking Algorithms:** Stacks facilitate backtracking algorithms by storing intermediate states and backtracking to the previous state when needed.
5. **Memory Management:** Stacks are used in memory management systems to allocate and deallocate memory for function calls and local variables.

## Queue

### Brief Summary of Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure.

Follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

It allows elements to be inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. **Enqueue Operation:** Adding elements to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue Operation:** Removing the frontmost element from the queue.
3. **Front and Rear Pointers:** Keeping track of the front and rear ends of the queue.
4. **Empty Queue:** Handling cases where the queue is empty to prevent underflow errors.
5. **Full Queue:** Managing cases where the queue is full to prevent overflow errors.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. **Job Scheduling:** Queues are used in operating systems for scheduling tasks and managing process execution.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Queues are essential in implementing BFS traversal algorithms in graphs and trees.
3. **Printer Spooling:** Queues are employed in printer spooling systems to manage print jobs in the order they are received.
4. **Buffering:** Queues are used in communication systems and I/O operations to buffer incoming data before processing.
5. **Transaction Processing:** Queues are utilized in transaction processing systems to handle requests in the order they are received, ensuring fairness and consistency.

## LoopQueue

The LoopQueue reduces the complexity of the dequeue of Queue from O(n) to O(1).

LoopQueue is a type of queue implementation, characterized by a circular buffer data structure. In this data structure, elements are stored in a fixed-size array according to the order of insertion, with the ability to reuse the array space by circling around it, hence the term "loop."

The circular queue maintains two pointers, one pointing to the front of the queue and another pointing to the rear. When elements are enqueued, the rear pointer moves forward, and when elements are dequeued, the front pointer advances. When the rear pointer reaches the end of the array, if there is still space in the array, it can wrap around to the beginning, effectively forming a loop.

Compared to regular queues, circular queues avoid the overhead of resizing the array and moving elements frequently, thus improving efficiency. However, it's important to note that circular queues have a fixed capacity, and attempting to enqueue when the queue is full will result in overflow.
