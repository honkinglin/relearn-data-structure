## Red-Black Tree

Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, where each node contains an extra bit representing the color (either red or black) and must satisfy specific properties to ensure balanced performance.

### Brief Summary of Red-Black Tree:

Red-Black Tree is a binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit representing its color: red or black.

Red-Black Trees must satisfy the following properties:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is always black.
3. Red nodes cannot have red children (i.e., no two red nodes can be adjacent).
4. Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes (leaves) contains the same number of black nodes. This property ensures that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice the length of the shortest path.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a Red-Black Tree contains the key, value (or payload), color (red or black), and pointers to its left and right children, as well as its parent.

2. **Coloring Rules**: Red-Black Trees enforce the coloring rules to maintain balance. Insertions and deletions may violate these rules temporarily, but the tree is adjusted through rotations and recoloring to restore balance.

3. **Balancing Operations**: Red-Black Trees perform rotations (left or right) and color flips (changing the colors of nodes) to rebalance the tree after insertions and deletions.

4. **Insertion**: When inserting a new node into a Red-Black Tree, the tree may become unbalanced. To restore balance, the tree may need to undergo rotations and recoloring operations.

5. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from a Red-Black Tree may also lead to imbalance. The tree adjusts itself through rotations and recoloring to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:

1. **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**: Red-Black Trees are used in the implementation of the `std::map` and `std::set` data structures in C++ STL for efficient storage and retrieval of elements in sorted order.

2. **Databases**: Red-Black Trees are used in database indexing structures to maintain ordered indices efficiently, allowing for quick search and retrieval operations.

3. **Memory Allocators**: Red-Black Trees can be used in memory allocators for managing memory blocks efficiently, ensuring balanced allocation and deallocation operations.

4. **Operating Systems**: Red-Black Trees are used in operating systems for tasks such as managing process scheduling, file systems, and resource allocation, where efficient data structures are required.

5. **Compiler Design**: Red-Black Trees are employed in compiler design for symbol table management, where identifiers and their attributes are stored and retrieved efficiently during the compilation process.
