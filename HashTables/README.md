## Hash Table

A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. It uses a hashing function to compute an index where the value can be stored or retrieved quickly.

### Brief Summary of Hash Table:

A Hash Table is an array-based data structure that uses a hashing function to map keys to indices in an array.

The key-value pairs are stored in an array, where the index of each pair is determined by applying a hashing function to the key.

Hash Tables typically handle collisions, where two keys hash to the same index, using techniques like chaining (each index stores a linked list of key-value pairs) or open addressing (search for an alternate location to store the value).

Hash Tables offer fast average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, often O(1), but performance may degrade to O(n) in the worst case.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:

1. **Hashing Function**: A hashing function takes a key as input and computes a hash code, which is used to determine the index where the value will be stored in the array.

2. **Collision Handling**: Hash Tables handle collisions that occur when two different keys hash to the same index. Techniques like chaining or open addressing are used to resolve collisions.

3. **Array-based Storage**: The key-value pairs are stored in an array, and the index of each pair is determined by the hashing function.

4. **Load Factor**: The load factor of a Hash Table is the ratio of the number of elements stored to the size of the array. It affects the performance of the Hash Table and may trigger resizing operations.

5. **Resizing**: Hash Tables may need to be resized dynamically to maintain a low load factor and prevent performance degradation. Resizing involves creating a new, larger array and rehashing all the key-value pairs.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:

1. **Databases**: Hash Tables are used in database indexing structures to store and retrieve records efficiently based on keys, providing fast lookup operations.

2. **Caching Mechanisms**: Hash Tables are used in caching mechanisms to store recently accessed data for quick retrieval, improving performance by reducing the need for expensive computations or I/O operations.

3. **Symbol Tables**: Hash Tables are used in compilers and interpreters to implement symbol tables, where identifiers and their associated attributes are stored and retrieved efficiently during the compilation or interpretation process.

4. **Hash-based Data Structures**: Hash Tables serve as the underlying data structure for implementing other hash-based data structures like HashSet and HashMap, which provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

5. **Distributed Systems**: Hash Tables are used in distributed systems for tasks such as load balancing, distributed caching, and consistent hashing, where efficient data storage and retrieval are essential.
