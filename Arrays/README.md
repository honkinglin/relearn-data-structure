## Array

### Brief Summary of Array:
An array is a linear data structure.

Stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. 

Each element is accessed using an index.

### Key Points in Implementing this Data Structure:
1. **Memory Allocation:** Allocate a contiguous block of memory to hold the elements.
2. **Indexing:** Assign unique indices to each element starting from zero.
3. **Accessing Elements:** Access elements directly using their indices for fast retrieval.
4. **Insertion and Deletion:** Inserting and deleting elements may require shifting other elements to maintain contiguity.
5. **Fixed Size:** Arrays have a fixed size determined at creation, limiting dynamic resizing.
6. **Homogeneous Elements:** Arrays store elements of the same data type, ensuring uniform memory allocation.
7. **Traversal:** Traverse the array sequentially to access or modify elements.

### Practical Applications of this Data Structure:
1. **Data Storage:** Arrays are widely used to store and manipulate collections of data in computer programs.
2. **Algorithm Implementation:** Arrays serve as a foundation for implementing various algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
3. **Efficient Data Access:** Arrays provide efficient access to elements using index-based retrieval, making them suitable for tasks requiring fast data access, such as image processing and numerical computations.
4. **Memory Management:** Arrays offer efficient memory management by allocating a contiguous block of memory, reducing fragmentation and improving memory access times.
